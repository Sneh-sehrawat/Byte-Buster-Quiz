The C++ Quiz Application named Byte Buster Quiz is a software project designed to provide an interactive and educational platform for users to test their knowledge of the C++ programming language. The application aims to offer a user-friendly quiz experience with a diverse range of questions that cover various aspects of C++ programming, from basic concepts to advanced topics. The application allows users to create accounts and log in securely. User data is stored for tracking progress and maintaining individual quiz histories. A comprehensive question bank is integrated into the system, covering fundamental C++ concepts such as syntax, data types, control structures, functions, classes, and more. Questions are categorized based on difficulty levels. There are 3 levels in this quiz from basic, moderate to advance. Users can select the desired difficulty level and topic to generate custom quizzes. Randomization ensures that each quiz is unique, preventing predictability. Immediate feedback is provided after each question, indicating whether the user's response was correct or incorrect. The application keeps track of userâ€™s scores and displays them at the end of each quiz. Users can view their overall performance and assess their strengths and weaknesses in different areas of C++.
